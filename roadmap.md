  - Images/fonts/assets
  - future maintainability is important here

  - Do we need Access Control for this? can we offload it to googleAuth?
  - Do we want to track volunteer activities
  - Potential scope creep : volunteer activities dashboard, to see what the volunteers are doing on a daily/weekly/monthly basis
- Payments platform
  - Donor Acknowledgement auto emails?
  - Donor frequency and amount tracking
  - potential scope creep : dashboard
  - accountability dashboard (let donors see how their money is spent) `this may not be a popular idea with the NGO`

  - Blog? Self hosted? Static site driven? Medium reposting?
  - Email service/mailing list
